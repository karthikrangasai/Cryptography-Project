# Cryptography-Project
A coursework project on implementation of Blockchain.
Demonstrates a voting system using blockchain.

Works on Python 3.5.2 and Flask 1.0.2

# Instructions
1. Use a virtual environment creator like virtualenv (in my case) to create a python virtual environment.
2. Create a python virtual environment using the command `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.5 venv`
3. Python 3.5.2 must be running in the virtual environment
4. Install flask 1.0.2 in the virtual environemt using `pip install flask==1.0.2`
5. Now, fork and clone this repository to work with it.
6. Running `python flaskApp.py` should start the flask server that runs the program.
7. The program initiates a blockchain and adds the genesis block.
